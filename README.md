For step 1, I used a while loop because I didn't know the specific amoungt of iterations. For Step 2, I used a for loop because range was involved and there was a set number of steps.
For step 3, I used a nested for loop because a grid was beding used. In step 1, the user is to input a number. If it is even, it's then divided by 2. If it is odd, it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. For step 2, the user inputs a number. If it's less than or equal to 1, it's not valid. the loop checks each number from 2 up to n - 1. If the number divides evenly, it's prime. If not, it's not prime. In step 3, numbers 1-10 are printed in a row.Then, it prints the row number and products for each column. Lastly, AI was used to figure out when nested for loops would be used. 
"Use nested for loops when:

You are working with grids, tables, or matrices

You know how many rows/columns you need"
